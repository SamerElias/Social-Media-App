# Social Media App


This app was made for the sake of learning a new stack MERNG - MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS and GraphQL.

I learned how to implement a GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to a social media app back-end.

In the app, you can: 

* View posts by different user
* Create a user
* Log in an already existing user
* Create a post 
* Like + Comment on a post
